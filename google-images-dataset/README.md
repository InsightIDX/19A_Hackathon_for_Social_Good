# google-images-dataset
This repository provides the necessary code to create your own Google Images Dataset in the form of an interactive Jupyter Notebook. Unlike other downloaders, to the best of my knowledge, this method respects [Google's Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66357?hl=en).
To be able to run this tutorial you will need to have the latest version of the fastai library installed. 

If using conda:

``` bash
conda update conda
conda install -c fastai fastai
```

If using pip:
```bash
pip install fastai
```
